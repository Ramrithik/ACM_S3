## <B> For git exercises i have mainly used commands like git status to check what's changed ,git add to stage files,git commit to save changes, and git log --oneline to see commit history and i also used git push to upload work, git checkout to switch branches, git diff to see changesvand git reset to undo things. These basic commands helped  me to solve most exercise problems.
